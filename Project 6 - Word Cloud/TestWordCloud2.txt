In buddhism there are four noble truths
the truth of suffering
the truth of the cause of suffering
the truth of the cessation of suffering
the truth of the path to cessation of suffering

samsara is suffering
samsara is nirvana
everything is empty of inherent existence

emptiness is also fullness
it is an inherent quality of life that is also full of the inherent qualities of buddha-nature
compassion, empathy, willingness to remain in samsara until the liberation of all sentient beings.

Theravada buddhism is concerned with personal liberation
Madhyamaka buddhism argues that true understanding of emptiness leads to the desire for liberation of all beings, not selfish desire to escape
Yogacara furthers this idea which meshes samsara and nirvana to the point where everything is mind, though we can use the mind to try to understand and escape to a better mindset

Tantric buddhism is associated with sex in western culture, but really it is just a focus on the body and the mind's natural connection to it
Using the body which has previously been a large and impossible obstacle to achieve liberation seems logical

Modern tantra is quite clean, though it originated as a counter-culture which was focused on the equanimity of all things; good or evil, pleasuring or disgusting.
